# timothyae.com

Welcome to my personal, but public, website. This website has started in 2008, has been planned to deprecate in favor of another TLD, but survived the pandemic until today.

I have decided to give my site another fresh look, and to archive all of the post I did in the past.

I started this site with Drupal 6. At a point, I upgraded to Drupal 7. And in 2017 I moved to Jekyll.

Before, I had several linux server instances in AWS, Digital Ocean, Linode, and Vultr for this site, which I am paying for $5 to $10 monthly for years. This site now is hosted in Netlify for free since 2017 when I moved to Jekyll.

I tried coming up with my own design and theme in the past, and all, but I quickly lost appetite with the looks of what I'm converting from design to Drupal or Jekyll theme. So everything ends up unfinished. I did it several times. I gave up several times too. This time, I'm using, a free Jekyll theme, which doesn't need me to convert from one framework to the other, etc. (e.g. from plain html to jekyll). See below for the credits.

This site has been under construction since 2008.
