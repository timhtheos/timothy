Today, being Sunday, will make the effectivity of my resignation, as part of the
last week.

Yep, I resigned a month ago, last May 14, 2017, Sunday. It was an irrevocable resignation.

In my resignation, I laid down 3 main reasons as to why, and the 3rd one is the
main one - health reasons.  I wanted to take a rest for a couple of weeks to a 
couple of months, maybe.

The following day, May 15, Monday, my best friend submitted his notice of
resignation too; while mine, was formally accepted on that day too.

The following day, Tuesday, in an i-Team, both our names were mentioned by the
CEO of the company.  His resignation acceptance was made on that day.

Last week's Wednesday, June 14, was my final day. The following day, all of my
access were revoked.  The day before that, I thought of writing a bash script to
export hipchat chat messages.  And so I did, on Thursday.

Disclaimer:

~~~
I did not export the company's chat messages whether it be private or group.

But in here, I want to share it:

Back to the present... Earlier, I bought a new domain name, (dot) life as its TLD
and timothy as its domain name.

It's:  timothy.life

Just for fun, I may set up a jekyll site on that domain name and I will use
github and netlify to automate production pushes.  That's a `may` still.

It's a new domain name in a dot life extension, after the fact of being
resingned.  A new life awaits.
