Last week, I was here, bound to Manila.  I spent my weekend there.  Today, I am here again, bound to Manila to spend the whole week there, maybe, and may be extended to even few more days there.

This weekend, I will be meeting old college friends, an old CS friend, old and new work colleagues/friends, and of course, new friends; thanks to Jary who's my mentor in making friends.

Next Monday, it will just be a normal work day/night for me.

Next Tuesday until Thursday, I will be attending a conference in CRBC at Cubao.  During these days, I will be meeting again my seminary friends, classmates as well as friends from Bacolod and Ilo-ilo City.

Next Friday, it will be another normal work day/night.  I may request work offset in the Morning (Cebu shift) and go back to Cebu, or I don't know.  Next Saturday and Sunday, I don't know either.  Next next Monday, I don't know, uuugh.  Next next Tuesday, if I am still in Manila, I'll fly back with Gerold back to Cebu.

And that's my itinerary.

But anyhow, just this night shift / US shift of work, it's my first time to be in a meeting for more than 3 hours in total - a stand-up for about 20 minutes, and 2 meetings consecutively for an hour each, and a scrum for 2 projects for 30 minutes.  Then I did some project push and went ahead to the airport while Jenkins is doing its job.  Then another meeting, supposedly 1.5 hours but was canceled due to me being late because I was still on a cab that time, to the airport.  So it should have been 4.5+ hours of meetings in total.  I actually haven't done any coding for today, but will do when I arrive in Manila.  I just make sure that it won't get past the period of time by which I will be forfeited of an incentive of having an EOD 8-hour log (or more) in my work timesheet.

Hours from now, I will be on a big plane - have been to several times, but first time with Cebu Pacific.  Just saying.

Ok, the sun is up now. Gotta stop this; will review some Jira tickets assigned to me, so that I can have an overview of which to pick first later for work.  Should anything happen to the plane, it will be just fine.  Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?"  Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  In short, it's not a problem with me.  The method of dying on an airplane is actually preferred than to die by drowning.

Soli Deo Gloria!
