The third and last day in CRBC, I got additional 3 books.

After lunch time, I booked an Uber for my friends in Ilo-ilo City to their destination to catch their trip back to Ilo-ilo, from Manila.

The event ended well.  I went home by walking form the venue to MRT Cubao station.  However, the train stopped in Shaw Blvd. because the rails are broken somewhere in the next station, Boni station.  Shaw blvd was our last stop, and the train can't go any farther.  I went down the train and went down the station.  I can still memorise where to go.  Recall, I live in Mandaluyong before for more than a year, 4 to 5 years ago.  The places look familiar and it was memorable.  I took a bus from there, in front of Nice Hotel to MOA, and walked form MOA to Sea Residences.  This is a tiring day.  I need to nap, because later I will have work again at 10 PM.

Soli Deo Gloria!
