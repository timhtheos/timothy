> My resolutions shalt fail if not by Thy grace and mercy.  Should I then retract from making commitments to myself and before the Lord?  Perish that thought.  I shalt go on to maturity and perfection, and by perfection, I do not mean moral sinlessness, but rather making Thee the chief and the highest end of myself and everything.  I am resolved, to remind myself always, that Thy judgement and discipline begin in the Thine house.  Lord, give what Thou commandest, and command what Thou wilt.

Resolved, not to do it again. I regret this day, this very hour, 3:00 AM, where I have sinned against Thee and the one I love. Di ko gid kaya. Indi nagid ko mag liwat. ;-(
Resolved, not to again.

I have promised before, NOT TO.

Lord, give what Thou commandest, and command what Thou wilt.

I earnestly, ask for forgiveness.

Law-ay law-ay gid sang feelings.
