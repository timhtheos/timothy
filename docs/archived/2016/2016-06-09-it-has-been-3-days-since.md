So to keep me from becoming conceited, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.

I have kept feeding the thorn that I have, until I have resolved that I won't do it again.  Many times I have pleaded with God about this, that it should leave me, but I know, His grace is sufficient for me, for His power is made perfect in my weakness.

Therefore, I will boast all of the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that His power may rest upon me.  For His sake, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities.

So be it.
