Right now, I am.  Why did I go here as early as Saturday in the first place?  
I could have come here Sunday night, as originally planned.  
I don't know, but I think I gotta pursue my plan.  
Right now, I don't know why there's something missing, and I am still not so happy.  
I hope everything will change after this week.  I hope I still have someone to look forward to.  It's all or nothing.  I'm lost.
