  I use Comodo's PositiveSSL for this website, timothyae.com.  However,
  after Let's Encrypt has been released and after I used it to 2 of my
  subdomains, I have finally decided to move to this open source SSL.
  Yesterday, I created SSL certificate for both timothyae.com and
  www.timothyae.com.

I use Comodo's PositiveSSL for this website, timothyae.com.  However, after Let's Encrypt has been released and after I used it to 2 of my subdomains, I have finally decided to move to this open source SSL.

Yesterday, I created SSL certificate for both timothyae.com and www.timothyae.com.

Now, what will happen to my Comodo's PositiveSSL?

> Answer:  I will not be using it anymore.  I'll just leave it until it expires.

Can it be used to other domain names?

> Yes, it can be used to other domain names.  This has an unlimited certificate reissue.

Can someone have it?

> Yes. I can give it to someone who is interested in using it, or even for experiment.

When is its expiration?
