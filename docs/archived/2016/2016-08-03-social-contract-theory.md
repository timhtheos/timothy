As much as I want to close my eyes on simple petty things, I just can't.  I am too sensitive to the smallest details.  I am governed by a lot of rules, latin legal maxims, among others.  Now, one of the things I keep my eyes closed, has to do with the social contract theory.  Let's dig dipper and define what it is.

Taken from http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/, it is defined as:

> Social contract theory, nearly as old as philosophy itself, is the view that persons' moral and/or political obligations are dependent upon a contract or agreement among them to form the society in which they live.

And there from the link I shared above, contains a lot of information about it, from its roots, to its practical and pragmatical application.

To sum it up, is to re-iterate the very definition I quoted above.  That's how I govern, my self, in every organization and relationship from micro to macro.  That's fairness.  That will keep things sane, and in order, and further avoid conflicts.  If we are to abandon it, we may want to live alone in an island.

No one is an island.  We all know that.  Even to the very independent person depends on something.  To be alone in an island means not using monetary instrument by the government.  It also means, you need to start from the start, by not using things from others, e.g., cellphone, laptop, television, internet.

Personally I am tired of practicing what Socrates has argued, what Plato has practice, among other great men in the past who observes it.

This lends truism to the fact that everything dies.  The things I love, most are gone; some are leaving; and some will certainly die.  That's the sad reality.  To end this, social contract theory starts when you need to do something that is conditional to others, e.g., cellphones and computers.  It journeys with communication; it dies without it.

Anyhow, I got to go to sleep.
