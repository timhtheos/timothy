I had two series of weird dreams for two consecutive days.

Yesterday, I dreamt that Miriam Defensor Santiago died.  I woke up after it and instantly checked my phone to verify if she indeed died.  She didn't.  I went back to sleep again.

Earlier, I dreamt that Richard Gordon died.  I woke and did not verify my phone if he indeed died.  I went back to sleep and waited, and waited 'til I arrive at the office to check.  He did not die.

I am waiting tomorrow, who will be the next; this time I want it to be true.

P.S. I still hold a cessationist view-point on the matter.  I have not deviate from it, unless I am convinced my the Text.

Today is the fourth day since.  Coram Deo.
