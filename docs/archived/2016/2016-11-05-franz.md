# {{ page.title }}

Someone has introduced me to [Franz](http://meetfranz.com/). I installed the next
day using `brew`, and used it.

To know more about it, just visit their [official website](http://meetfranz.com/).

Anyhow, I used Franz for the following messengers:
# Google Apps Mail
# Fb Messenger
# HipChat
# Skype
# Steam
# My SMS
# LinkedIn
# Google Hangout

I then stopped using the native apps of those individual apps, and only used
Franz.

The following are what I have observed thus far.

## Skype

I blocked someone from Skype using the [Franz app](http://meetfranz.com/) and got
surprised we still exchanged messages day afterwards.

I opened Skype native Mac app, and that someone is blocked - I can't send a
message, neither can receive a message.

Also, I'm using OSX, and the embedded Skype app they use is that of Windows.

## Fb Messenger

I need to refresh the tab just to see updated friend status.

Or, I can message a friend, to see their updated status.

By `status`, I mean, whether they are online or not, and if not, how long have
they been inactive since.

## Action

Simple.

I just have decided not to use it anymore and to go back to individual OSX native
apps.
