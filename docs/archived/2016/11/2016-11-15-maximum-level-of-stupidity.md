I had a drink of wine with this not-so-fine and not-so-young lady in one
of the bars here in Cebu. We started with some exchange of information,
et. al.

TLTR;

We ended up arguing about the truth.

She said, there's no such thing as absolute truth. She claims all truths
are relative. Each has his/her/its own truths.

I asked her back, "Do you absolutely believe that there's no absolute
truth? And, that 'all truths are relative', is absolutely true?"

And, she said "Yes".

My arguments are over. I simply don't wanna be around with an idiot
simpleton like her. I can't handle such stupidity.
