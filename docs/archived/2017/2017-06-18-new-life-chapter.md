Today, being Sunday, will make the effectivity of my resignation, as part of the
last week.

Yep, I resigned a month ago, last May 14, 2017, Sunday. It was an irrevocable resignation.

In my resignation, I laid down 3 main reasons as to why, and the 3rd one is the
main one - health reasons.  I wanted to take a rest for a couple of weeks to a 
couple of months, maybe.

The following day, May 15, Monday, my best friend submitted his notice of
resignation too; while mine, was formally accepted on that day too.

The following day, Tuesday, in an i-Team, our names were mentioned by the
CEO of the company as an acknowledgement that the CEO has accepted our resignation.

Last week's Wednesday, June 14, was my final day. The following day, all of my
access were revoked.  The day before that, I thought of writing a bash script to
export hipchat chat messages.  And so I did, on Thursday.

Disclaimer: *I did not export the company's chat messages whether it be private or group.*

Here, I want to share what I wrote.
