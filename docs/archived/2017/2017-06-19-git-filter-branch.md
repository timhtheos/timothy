  Suppose, you want to move a directory from a repository A to be merged into
  another repository B. The noob approach would be just to copy the contents of
  the said directory from A to (that of) B.

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

{:toc}

## Scenario

### Assumption

1. Original repository: `A`.
2. Other repository: `B`.
3. Directory in `A` that we need to copy with commit history:
   `www/modules/custom/sms_gateway`
4. Directory in `B` that we need to copy into the files and commits from `A`:
   git root directory
5. Local path: `/var/www/demo/`.

### Case

Suppose, you want to move a directory from a repository `A` to be merged into
another repository `B`.  The noob approach would be just to copy the contents
of the said directory from `A` to (that of) `B`.

That however, will render all efforts of commits made in the direcotry in `A`
to just one commit in `B`.  This is something we want to avoid especially to
open source projects where commit history is important to the developers who
made them, and to the company they work in as credits.

Suppose, you want to retain git commit history made in repository `A` in that
particular directory.  This can be done by one-by-one re-committing changes
made in that directory in `A` to `B`.

Soon you will realize that you re-wrote the commit history made in the said
directory in `A` to `B` with you as the committer, author, and the dates of the
commits were done just now, not on the date those commits were originally made
in `A`.

That can be solved, by setting up the env variable for git committer name,
author name, and the date committed.  This however, would be very tedious.

## Solution

Let's use git's `filter-branch` command.

### Steps

1.  Clone `A`. Let's clone it in `/var/www/demo/`. Any path will do. I would
    suggest to clone a new one, than to use existing one where you currently
    work on.

    ```
    git clone A-git-url
    ```

2.  Go to `A`.

    ```
    cd /path/to/A
    ```

3.  Checkout to the branch you want.  E.g., `develop`.

4.  Let's remove the remote origin. This is to make sure we don't accidentally
    push changes we will about to make.

    ```
    git remote remove origin
    ```

5.  Now, let's do the filter-branch. This process will move the directory set
    in the filter-branch command, to the root of the repository. This means,
    all other files will be removed, and the ones that are left are the ones in
    the branch set in filter-branch.

    ```
    git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter www/modules/custom/sms_gateway -- --all
    ```

6.  Now, before we go ahead and merge the files and commit history to `B`, we
    need to have a new clone repository `B` first.  Same with `A`, it's better
    that we clone a new one, than working on the existing one.

    ```
    git clone B-git-url
    ```

7.  In `B` git checkout to the branch of your choice and then branch out to a
    new branch to do the merging of commits there.  You can do this to the
    original branch, but it's better to branch out to a different branch. There
    is no need to remove the remote origin from the newly cloned `B`.  Let's
    say, you branched out to `feature-commits-from-A` branch.

8.  In `B` add a new remote to be named to whatever you want, e.g., `from-A`.
    Confirm remotes, with `git remote -v`.  You should see, aside from
    `origin`, the `from-A`.  The remote url would be the local path of the
    newly cloned `A` earlier. The easiest way to do this is to go to /path/to/A
    and then `pwd` in its root.

    ~~~
    cd /path/to/A
    pwd
    cd /path/to/B
    git remote add from-A /path/to/A
    ~~~

    In command `pwd` above, just note or copy the its result as you need this in
    the last command to be substituted for `/path/to/A`.

    Again, in the last command, the `from-A` is the alias of the remote you
    just added.  `/path/to/A` is the local path of you newly cloned `A` you did
    a while ago.  Note that you should do this inside the newly cloned `B`.

9.  Now, let's do the merging.

    ~~~
    git fetch from-A
    git merge from-A/feature-commits-from-A
    ~~~

    If you encounter some error related to unrelated histories, you should
    add `--allow-unrelated-histories` in the second command.

    ~~~
    git merge from-A/feature-commits-from-A --allow-unrelated-histories
    ~~~

10. Confirm commit histories.  In `B` in branch `feature-commits-from-A`,
    just `git log` and see the commits.  You can check back in `A` for
    reference.

11. If you are satisfied, merge back branch `feature-commits-from-A` to the
    original branch, e.g, `develop`, or `8.x-1.x` - to the branch where
    `feature-commits-from-A` was branched out.

    ~~~
    git checkout 8.x-1.x
    git merge feature-commits-from-A
    git log
    ~~~

12. After all of the above, we now need to push to `B`. This is just a simple
    push.

    ~~~
    git push origin 8.x-1.x
    ~~~

That's it.

## Summary

Below are all commands used.

~~~
# Go to the local path where we want to do stuff.
cd /var/www/demo/

# Clone repos.
git clone A-git-url
git clone B-git-url

# In A.
cd /path/to/A
git checkout develop
git remote remove origin
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter www/modules/custom/sms_gateway -- --all

# In B.
cd /path/to/B
git checkout 8.x-1.x
git checkout -b feature-commits-from-A
git remote add from-A /path/to/A
git fetch from-A
git merge from-A/feature-commits-from-A --allow-unrelated-histories
git checkout 8.x-1.x
git merge feature-commits-from-A
git log
git push origin 8.x-1.x
