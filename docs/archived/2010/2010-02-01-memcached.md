## About Memcache
- *from memcached.org*
- It is free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.
- It is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.
- It is simple yet powerful.
- Its simple design promotes quick deployment, ease of development, and solves many problems facing large data caches.
- Its API is available for most popular languages.

## Memcached Users
Memcached should not be underestimated.  Its use will make a big difference for websites with TBs and PBs of files/DBs.  It's just used by no less than the following big websites:

* LiveJournal
* Wikipedia
* Flickr
* Bebo
* Twitter
* Typepad
* Yellowbot
* Youtube
* Digg
* WordPress.com
* Craigslist
* Mixi

## Ubuntu 11.10 Installation and setup using CLI

1.  Install memcached

    ~~~~
    sudo apt-get install memcached libmemcached-tools
    sudo apt-get install memcached libmemcached-tools
    ~~~~

2.  Install memcached php extension using PECL

    ~~~
    sudo apt-get install php5-dev php-pear make
    sudo pecl install memcache
    ~~~

3.  Edit your `php.ini` file

    ~~~
    sudo vim /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
    ~~~

    Then, insert the following line into it:

    ~~~
    extension=memcache.so
    ~~~

4.  Restart apache and start memcache

    ~~~
    sudo service apache2 restart
    sudo service apache2 restart
    ~~~

5.  That's it, you're done. The following are optionals:

    To check if memcache is running, run

    ~~~
    sudo service memcached status
    ~~~

    Note that memcache's default port is `11211`. To check if it is active and listening to that port, run

    ~~~
    netstat -tap | grep memcached
    ~~~

    To check the status and stats, use memstat tool, where 127.0.0.1 is the local or public IP address.

    ~~~
    memstat 127.0.0.1:11211
    ~~~

    If memstat is not yet installed, install it with

    ~~~
    sudo apt-get install memstat
    ~~~

## Configuring Memcache

Configuring memcache can be done by editing the configuration file that can be found in `/etc/memcached.conf`.

To edit

~~~
sudo vim /etc/memcached.conf
~~~

To change default memory (64 MB), look for the following lines:

~~~
# Start with a cap of 64 megs of memory. It's reasonable, and the daemon default
# Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much
# memory
-m 64
~~~

To effect changes, restart memcache and apache2.

~~~
sudo service memcached restart
sudo service apache2 restart
~~~

## Use Memcache with Drupal 7.x

1.  Edit `php.ini` file.

    ~~~
    sudo vim /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
    ~~~

    Append the following line:

    ~~~
    memcache.hash_strategy=consistent
    ~~~

2.  Install and activate a drupal module `Drupal Memcache`

3.  Edit settings.php of Drupal isntance to include:

    ~~~
    $conf['cache_backends'][] = 'sites/all/modules/memcache/memcache.inc';
    $conf['cache_default_class'] = 'MemCacheDrupal';
    $conf['memcache_key_prefix'] = 'unique';
    ~~~

    where `unique` is whatever word you want. This is important if you have multiple instances of drupal running with memcache in a single server.

## Use Memcache with Drupal 6.x

Perform the same steps in Drupal 7.x except step No. 3.

For step 3, include the following, instead:

~~~
$conf['cache_inc'] ='sites/all/modules/memcache/memcache.inc';
~~~
