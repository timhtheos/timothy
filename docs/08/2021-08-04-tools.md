{% include toc.html %}

This is an update to an old article [Tools I use](/tools-i-use).

## Editor / IDE

[vim](https://www.vim.org/)
  : I have been a `vim` user for 7 years. I started in 2014.

## Vim plugin manager

[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
: `Vundle` is short for `Vim Vundle`.
: A former colleague said he is using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/), so I have decided to use an alternative.

## Vim plugins

For comprehensive list, see my [vim rc file](https://github.com/timhtheos/dotfiles/blob/2020-01-31/vimrc).

As of posting, the last update of my vim rc file, was 2 years ago. There
are changes on my local that weren't pushed to the repository; and I also
have different versions of vim rc file depending on the host operating
system.

As of now, they will stay on my local.

Here are some plugins that I use:

[easymotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion)
: This provides a much simplier way to use some motions in vim.

[fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
: This is a git wrapper for vim.

[nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
: I seldom use this but this provides a sidebar directory structure in vim.

[syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)
: I use all the time with vim, passively. This checks code syntax of what I write when I save it. See the following screenshot:
: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scrooloose/syntastic/master/_assets/screenshot_1.png)
: *Img src: https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic*

[ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
: This I use all the time. This is a full path fuzzy `file, buffer, mru, tag, ...` finder for vim.

[delimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate)
: I also use this all the time, passively. This plugin provides automatic closing of quotes, parenthesis, brackets, among others.

[tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)
: I use this when needed especially with tables. See [vimcast](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/aligning-text-with-tabular-vim/).

[tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar)
: I seldom use this when needed. This provides a sidebar to vim for all tags in the current file, among others.

[indent-guides](https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides)
: Indent guides for vim.

[markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown)
: A markdown highlighter in vim.

[emmet](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim)
: A support for expanding abbreviations.
: Example: type in `html:5` and press `Ctrl y` and `,`
: The above will become
: ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang=en>
  <head>
    <meta charset=UTF-8>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
  ```

{% include ad_inline.html %}

[sparkup](https://github.com/rstacruz/sparkup)
: Similar to emmet but can do more.  For examples, see [here](https://github.com/rstacruz/sparkup#examples).

[YouCompeleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
: A code completion engine for Vim. See animated screenshot below:
: ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1f3f922431d5363224b20e99467ff28b04e810e2/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f304f50346f6f642e676966)
: *Img src: https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe*

[Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline)
: This is a statusline plugin for vim, and provides statuslines and prompts for several other applications, including zsh, bash, tmux, IPython, Awsome and Qtile.

[gist](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim)
: A vimscript in creating gists in gist.github.com. To create gist, one can just `:Gist` and `ENTER`. Then, it will return the link to your gist. This however, requires [webapi](https://github.com/mattn/webapi-vim) for this plugin to work.

## Terminal

iTerm 2
: When in Mac, I use iTerm 2.

guake
: When in Linux, I use guake.

## Shell

[zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
: `zsh` is a shell designed for interactive use.

[Bourne-again shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
: *Bash* is a Unix shell as a free software replacement for Bourne shell.

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
: This is a plugin.
: It is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
: ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0b07def9e05309281212369b118fcf9b9fc7948e/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f6a756e6567756e6e2f692f6d61737465722f667a662e676966)
: *Img src: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf*

: When I am lost where I am with vim, I just use fzf's plugin for vim
with `:FZF`. This does not create vim buffer, so as much as possible, I
stick with `ctrlp` vim plugin.

## ZSH manager and plugins

[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
: A community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes 180+ optional plugins (rails, git, OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, php, python, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool so that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community. 

[z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z)

: A native `zsh` port of `z.sh`.
