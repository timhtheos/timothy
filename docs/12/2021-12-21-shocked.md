## On people’s appetite for a shock

When prime minister Harold Wilson tells the Queen that he has alzheimer’s, and he is going to resign, the Queen says

> This will come as a terrible shock.

Wilson responds by saying

> Well, maybe, but, uh… No shock lasts longer than 48 hours. There’s too much appetite for the next shock.
