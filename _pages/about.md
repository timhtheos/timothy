Hola!

I'm `Timothy`. My name comes from two Greek words, `Timh`, _honor or
respect_, and `Theos`, _God_. My name, therefore and literally means,
`honoring God`.

## A little background about my religious belief worldview 
1.  I am a devout Augustinian. Don't mistake me as a member of the Roman
    Catholic Church.
2.  I am a 5-point(er) staunch Calvinist. Yes, my belief system sprang
    out from `the` great Reformation.
3.  I am a trying hard, and always reforming, and intolerant Puritan.
    Don't get me wrong, I am what I am, by the Grace of God.
4.  Lastly, my denominational affiliation is that of `Reformed` Baptist.

## A little background about other things I do and like
1.  I work as a Drupal web developer. I just recently got Acquia
    Certification.
2.  I like and love linux.
3.  I like Bash coding.
4.  I would love to be involved in CI and deployment.
5.  I am fond of reading theological books, _before_.
6.  I am fond of reading law books, and latest jurisprudence from
    sc.judiciary.gov.ph.  I also listen to lenghty oral arguments before
    the SC.
7.  I currently study _Reformed_ Theology at Ilo-ilo City.

## This Site (then and now)

**Then**. The purpose of this site has to do with Drupal - Code Driven
Development, Site Automation, and Module Development.  Also, I started
to love Markdown, so I made my old Drupal site to use Markdown.

**Now**. I want to cut server fees, and I just want simplicity, while
keeping Markdown.

## Other likes
1.  **Theology**. Theology matters. Time will come, I will become an
    intolerant.
2.  **Politics**. I hate it in workplace, but it's everywhere.
3.  **Law and Jurisprudence**. Reading latest jurisprudence, may make me
    sound arrogant, but never stupid. Let's debate.

## Some thoughts of being me
Don't be like me. I'm hopeless - forever alone, no friend, no family
(broken family), and has vices.

## Other info and whereabouts
I came from Bacolod City and grew up there, and now currently living in
Cebu City.
